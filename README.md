# linkedin_reach_code_sample_cart

This repository outlies the shopping cart functionality I have implemented in Welrus. 

Users can add items to the shopping cart, and each addition of items are sent to the backend, and a new cart is created for that user.

Users can empty out the cart, or remove certain items from it.
